- Demographics: Age, Gender
- Job information: Job type, Satisfaction score
- Work metrics: Productivity (in hours), Burn-out days, Stress level
- Screen behavior: Time spent on social media, Notifications per day

---

### 🔧 Data Preparation
- Cleaned and standardized columns
- Derived:
  - `Age Group` from age
